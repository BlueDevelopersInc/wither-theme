# Compatibility with addons/plugins

This theme may not be compatible with some (if not most) addons or plugins, but if there is one that you really need, you can contact me on discord ill try help you make it compatible, Discord: BlueTree242#7542

## Note:
1. This theme comes with a plugins manager, not the official one, just one that i made myself! Just make sure you are using the latest wings.
2. This theme is outdated, it's about 3 versions behind current pterodactyl versions (missing network usage tab and activity log currently)
3. Backup your `.env` file located in `/var/www/pterodactyl` just in case anything fails, but make sure not to give that file to anyone or expose it in any way
# Installation
By installing this panel you agree to use a development build of pterodactyl panel, and removal of any other themes or plugins/addons installed on your panel (you can reinstall them, some plugins may need some other modifications to get stuff working with this theme)

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine
2. Copy all the files to the panel installation directory, usually at `/var/www/pterodactyl`. 
3. Build the panel, [here is how](https://pterodactyl.io/community/customization/panel.html)

And then you have a fresh installation of pterodactyl, with this theme (servers, users or any data saved by pterodactyl won't get removed)
