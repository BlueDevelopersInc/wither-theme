# Installation
By installing this panel you agree to use a development build of pterodactyl panel, and removal of any other themes or plugins/addons installed on your panel

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine
2. Copy all the files to the panel installation directory, usually at `/var/www/pterodactyl`. 
3. Build the panel, [here is how](https://pterodactyl.io/community/customization/panel.html)

And then you have a fresh installation of pterodactyl, with this theme (servers, users or any data saved by pterodactyl won't get removed)
