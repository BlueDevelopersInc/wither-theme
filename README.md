# Installation
By installing this panel you agree to use a development build of pterodactyl panel, and removal of any other themes or plugins/addons installed on your panel (you can reinstall them, some plugins may need some other modifications to get stuff working with this theme)

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine
2. Copy all the files to the panel installation directory, usually at `/var/www/pterodactyl`. 
3. Build the panel, [here is how](https://pterodactyl.io/community/customization/panel.html)

And then you have a fresh installation of pterodactyl, with this theme (servers, users or any data saved by pterodactyl won't get removed)
